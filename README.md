# Cat Attack - When Cats Attack!

A simple game to play with react.js and a Cat Api.

## The plan
Fetch data from a [Cat Api](https://thecatapi.com/) and use the dat to play a top trumps style game.

## Concepts Practised 
Using Postman to explore what data came back from the API.
(and saving the data to stop over calling the API).

Exploring the use of modals from [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-modal/).

Using the ternary operator in conditional rendering and for inline changes.

Created a custom hook to useFetch.
